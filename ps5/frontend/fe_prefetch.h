// Mupen64Plus PS5: the cover prefetch, as PS5SX2 does it (its fe_ps5.cpp, orbis_frontend_prefetch_covers).
//
// On the console the app downloads covers in one step at the very start, before it asks the helper for
// /data, with a 30 s budget; after that the shelf downloads nothing (PS5SX2: "the rest came from the
// prefetch, before the jailbreak"). The 1.6.1 console log showed why: on the shelf, after that request, every
// HTTPS GET failed at once (-1 in 23 ms) although the network was up.
//
// Before /data is visible the app can't read its game list, so the list of covers to fetch comes from the
// helper: covers/wanted.txt, which the app writes after each scan (fe_covers.h, MissingCovers). The covers are
// kept in memory and written to /data/mupen64plus/covers once the app can see it. When a scan finds covers that
// this start didn't try (new games), the app writes the list and starts itself again so the prefetch gets
// them, as PS5SX2 re-executes its own eboot (main-boot.cpp, ReturnForCovers).
